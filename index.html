      <section id="introduction">Introduction</section>

      We are motivated by understanding the following picture from the perspective of transformational geometry.

      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Apollonian_gasket.svg" style="width: 250px; display: block; margin: auto; cursor: pointer" onclick="window.open('https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apollonian_gasket.svg', '_blank');"/>
      <center style="margin-bottom:30px">An Apollonian Gasket</center>

      Recall that Möbius transformations $T$ are transformations of the extended complex plane (the Reimann Sphere) $\C^+$ of the form
      $$T(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$$
      for complex constants $a, b, c, d\in\C$ satisfying $ab-cd\neq 0$. These transformations form the Möbius group $\M$.

      It turns out that the key to understanding pictures like the Apollonian Gasket above is to study specific subgroups of $\M$. There is a more general concept that includes the types of groups we are going to explore, but we will focus on a particular kind of group that is easier to define in the context of an introductory course in transformational geometry.

      <section id="pairing-clines">Pairing Clines</section>

      We will say that two clines are "non-overlapping" if they intersect at most once.

      It is important to keep in mind that because we are working in the extended complex plane, there is no real distinction between the "interior" and "exterior" of a single cline. We are still going to use the words, but it won't be confusing. If the cline in question is a circle, your intuition won't lead you astray. When we refer to the interior of a line, it will always be in a very specific context: we have a set of non-overlapping clines, and there will be a side the line that does not contain the interior of another cline, and this region is the line's interior. <span style="color: red">Are we still being ambiguous about interiors and exteriors?</span>

      <definition>
        Given two clines $C$ and $C'$, suppose a Möbius transformation $T$ maps $C'$ to $C$, and also takes the exterior of $C'$ to the interior of $C$. Then $T$ is said to <b>pair the cline $C'$ to $C$</b>.
      </definition>

      In the definition above, $T$ must also take the interior of $C'$ to the exterior of $C$. Clearly, if $T$ pairs $C'$ to $C$, then $T^{-1}$ pairs $C$ to $C'$.

      <lemma>
        There is a unique cline $K(C, C')$ over which (by inversion) $C$ and $C'$ are symmetric.
      </lemma>
      <proof collapse="true" open="true">
        <span style="color: red">Katie, write this :)</span>

        Suppose $C_a(A)=C$ and $C_b(B)=C'$, then

        center of $K$: $A+a\frac{B-A}{a-b}$

        radius of $K$: $\sqrt{\frac{ab\|B-A\|}{(a-b)^2}-ab}$

        </proof>

      Any transformation $T$ that pairs $C'$ to $C$ can be written as the composition of the following maps.
      <ul>
        <li>Invert over $C$.</li>
        <li>Transform $C$ to the unit circle.</li>
        <li>Perform any transformation from the hyperbolic group (disk automorphism).</li>
        <li>Transform the unit circle back to $C$.</li>
        <li>Invert over the cline $K(C,C')$.</li>
      </ul>
      For now we will consider the case when the transformation chosen from the hyperbolic group is the identity. Algebraically, suppose $C$ has centers $p$ and radius $r$. Then any function $T:\C^+\to\C^+$ that pairs $C'$ to $C$ is of the form
      <!-- \begin{align*}
        T_2(z) & = \left(I_{K(C_1, C_2)} \circ T_{p_1} \circ H_{r_1} \circ T_\H\circ H_{1/r_1}\circ T_{-p_1}\circ I_{C_1}\right)(z).
      \end{align*}
      Yikes. For right now, we'll consider the case when $T_\H$ is the identity, so -->
      $$T(z) = \left(I_{K(C, C')} \circ I_{C}\right)(z).$$

      <lemma>
        The map $T$ is a loxodromic transformation, and the clines $C$ and $C'$ are type II for the two fixed points of $T$.
      </lemma>
      <proof collapse="true" open="true">
        Define $C_{q}(s)=K(C, C')$. Then
        \begin{align*}
          T(z) & = \left(I_{K(C, C')} \circ I_{C}\right)(z) \\
               & = \frac{r^2}{\overline{\left(\frac{s^2}{\overline{z - q}} + q\right) - p}} + p \\
               & = \frac{r^2}{\frac{\overline{s^2}}{z - q} + \overline{q-p_1}} + p \\
               & = \frac{r^2(z-q)}{\overline{s^2} + (\overline{q-p})(z-q)} + p \\
               & = \dots \\
               & = \left(\frac{r^2}{\overline{q-p}}+p\right)\frac{z - \left(\frac{r^2q+\overline{s^2} + q\left(\overline{q-p}\right)}{r^2+p\left(\overline{q-p}\right)}\right)}{z-\left(\frac{\overline{s^2} - q\left(\overline{q-p}\right)}{\overline{q-p}} \right)},
        \end{align*}
        so $T$ is clearly loxodromic.

        <span style="color:red">Katie, show that the mess in the numerator is the image under inversion over $C$ of the mess in the denominator.</span>

      <section>Schottky Groups</section>

      Schottky groups were first studied by Friedrich Schottky in 1877.

      <definition title="Schottky Group <cite to='ams'></cite>">
        A <strong>Schottky group</strong> is a Kleinian group generated by transformations $T_1,\dots, T_n$ where there are $2n$ disjoint simple loops, $C_1, C_1',\dots,C_n, C_n'$, bounding a common domain $F$ in the extended complex plane $\C^+$, where $T_i(C_i') = C_i$, and $T_i(F)\cap F=\emptyset$, $i = 1,\dots,n$.
      </definition>

      The loops $C_i$ and $C_i'$ are the <em>defining loops</em> for the Schottky group, however, they do not completely determine the group. Indeed, recall from our discussion of pairing clines that any hyperbolic transformation can be inserted in between the two inversions.

      For our purposes, we will assume that the loops are clines in $\C^+$. Consider a set $\mathcal{C}$ of $n$ pairs of (<span style="color:red">overall</span>) non-intersecting clines:
      $$\mathcal{C}=\{(C_1,C_1'), \dots, (C_n,C_n')\},$$
      and the associated set of pairing transformations (as defined earlier)
      $$\T=\{T_1, \dots, T_n\}.$$
      Define the "swiss cheese"-looking set
      $$F=\C^+-\bigcup_{i=1}^n \overline{D_i \cup D_i'}$$
      where $D_i^{(\prime)}$ is the largest open disk bounded by the cline $C_i^{(\prime)}$ so that no two disks intersect. Intuitively, $F$ is the extended plane with the clines and their "interiors" punched out.

      Let $G$ be the Schottky group generated by $\T$, and observe that $T_{i}^{(\prime)}\circ T\in G$ maps $F$ into (but not onto) the interior of $T(D_i^{(\prime)})$. The orbit $\O_F$ of $F$ tiles the plane, except for the point-set boundary of $\O_F$, which is the limit set of $G$. That is,
      $$H = \partial \O_F = \C^+ - \O_F.$$
      Also, due to the contstruction of $\T$, for any $T\in G$, $T(H) = H$.

      <br>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Conjecture.</strong> $\partial \O_F = \O_{\Phi(\T)} = \Phi(G)$, where $\Phi(X)$ defines the fixed point set $\{p\in\C^+\mid \exists T\in X, T(p)=p\}$.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Conjecture.</strong> $\Gamma:\mathcal{K}\to\mathcal{K}$ given by $\Gamma(X)=\O_X$ is a contraction mapping with fixed point $H$.
      </blockquote>

      <section>Limit Sets of Kleinian Groups</section>

      The study of Kleinian groups in generality started with Henri Poincaré and Felix Klein in 1883.

      <definition title="Kleinian Group <cite to='ams'></cite>">
        A <strong>Kleinian group</strong> is a discrete subgroup of $\text{PSL}(2,\C)$, the group of orientation-preserving conformal homeomorphisms of the extended complex plane, <span style="color:red"> and as the group of orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic 3-space.</span>
      </definition>

      <definition title="Kleinian Group <cite to='ucdavis'></cite>">
        A <strong>Kleinian group</strong> is a discrete subgroup of the group of transformations on the Reimann Sphere.
      </definition>


      <definition title="Limit and Discontinuity Set <cite to='ams'></cite>" >
        Given a Kleinian group $G$, we write $\Lambda(G)$ for its <strong>limit set</strong>, the set of limit points of the set $\{T(x)\mid T\in G\}$, <span style="color: red"> where $x$ is any point in hyperbolic three-space</span>. The complement of the limit set is called the <strong>discontinuity</strong> or <strong>regular set</strong> of $G$ and is denoted $\Omega(G)$.
      </definition>


      It is pointed out in <cite to="ams"></cite> that $\Lambda(G)$ is either
     <ol>
       <li>finite with cardinailty at most 2,</li>
       <li>uncountably infinite and perfect nowhere dense, or</li>
       <li>equal to $\C^+$.</li>
     </ol>

     We will build to some examples of the second case, which is clearly the most interesting and (perhaps, unsurprisingly) the most beautiful.
